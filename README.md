# analyticinsights
The dataset is tabular and the features involved should be self-explanatory. We would like for you to come up with a specific problem yourself and solve it properly. This is an “open challenge,” mainly focusing on natural language processing. The problem could be either about predictive modeling or providing analytical insights for some business use cases. Note the problem should be treated as large-scale, as the dataset is large (e.g., >100GB) and will not fit into the RAM of your machine. Python is strongly recommended in terms of the coding language.




Conclusions
From the above analysis we can interpert the following insights-

1) After finding the popular author based on up votes, we can increase our AD revenus by showing users relevant AD's on those pages.

2) Predict the number of up votes/down votes based on given title using machine learning

3) Find the best author to provide ranks based on up votes and rewards.

4) Find most unpopular and popular blogs in each category for users recommendation
